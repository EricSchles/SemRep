	------ OVERALL RESULT for: schoolname ------
	    Patcher: /home/abaki/RA/PLDI/PLDI14/experiments/schoolmate/schoolmate_header__schoolname.dot
	    Patchee: /home/abaki/RA/PLDI/PLDI14/experiments/schoolmate/schoolmate_header.dot
	    - validation patch is generated
	    - validation patch analysis time: 58
	    - second validation patch for length issue is generated
	    - sanitization patch is generated
